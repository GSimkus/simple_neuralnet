# About
A small and light (core code less than 20 lines of python) neural net constructed as a teaching example in Machine Learning. Based on @iamtrask's teaching posts on his blog.

Loads an input and output dataset, then loops 100000 times, backprogpagating error each loop to arrive at a trained net.
